## Vocalis

This is an AI driven website that allows users to desing realistic sounding human voices. To design a voice, the suer provides:

    1. The title
    2. The gender
    3. The age range
    4. The ethnicity
    5. A detailed description of the voice

These are then used to generate the voice

The user should be able to browse the generated voices in the voice gallery. They can organize the voices into albums for different use cases. They should be able to edit, download and delete both the voices and the albums. The albums each have a title and description.

Include a playgorund page. This is a page where the user can test out the designed voice. They select a voice and proceed to the playground page. Here, they can enter the text to speak and alter speech settings such as speaking rate, speaking style, the volume and any other applicable voice setting. From this page, they can edit and regenerate the voice to meet their requirements.

A dashboard should be present for the user to view and purchase credits

A payments and billing page should be present. The application uses a credit based system, not a monthly subscription. The payment uses MPesa and the Kenyan shilling as the currency. The user can pay using an stk push, a paybill or a till number as well as by scanning a qr code. Card payment is also enabled as fallback.

Inlude a registration and login page that uses password based authentication but also intergrates with Google OAuth through firebase.

## Application Flow
- For a new user:
    1. They land on the landing page
    2. They then proceed to the product page (they do not have to register or log in)
    3. They can then generate once
    4. To download the voices, they have to register or sign in

- For other users:
    1. They sign in or register
    2. They proceed to the dashboard page
    3. They can generate, view their generations, purchase tokens.

## Technologies
- Use domain driven design to craft the application. 
- Use rich domain models and domain events to communicate between different services. The domain models should use dataclasses, while at the API layer use pydantic for requests and responses validation
- The application should be a monolith
- Use FastAPI for the backend, with postgresql as the database and sqlalchemy as the orm. Make sure to use a virtual environment during development.
- Keep all the configurations in a dotenv file and create a global config object
- Use html, css and javascript for the frontend
- For payments, use MPesa intergrations and the currency unit is Kenyan shillings. The user should be able to pay by:

    1. Getting an STK push on their phone
    2. Paying via till or paybill
    3. Scanning a qr code
- As a fallback option implement payment by card

- For the front end include a minimal landing page, with the hero section and a how it works section. Also include a register and login page as well as a dashboard page, payments and billing pages, a gallery of all the previous generations. Build out the product page which should include a multi-step form. For guidance, an image is provided, showing the landing page for a face generation website. Repurpose the face generation site for this product.
